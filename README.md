The headlamp is with 8â‚¬ quit cheap but it has his fixed modes an power.
I made a smal PCB with the same outline as the original but placed a attiny85 and two AMC7135 on it.

As LED there ar two Cree LED XP-G, a white one with 172 lm @350mA and a red one with, X lm @350mA.

The PCB is in production right now and I hope that I did not screw it up...
